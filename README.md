# Countdown_timer
Overview
The Countdown Timer is a simple web application that allows users to set a countdown to a specific date and time. Once the user selects a date and time, the timer will start counting down to that target, showing the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining. When the countdown reaches zero, a message will display indicating that the countdown has finished.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Set Target Date and Time: Users can input a specific date and time.
Live Countdown: Displays the time remaining in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Finish Notification: Once the countdown reaches zero, a message is shown to indicate that the countdown has finished.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a good user experience.
Files
index.html: The HTML structure of the page, containing the input fields for date and time, the display for the countdown, and the message area.
countdown_styles.css: The CSS file that defines the styling and layout of the page, including responsive design, color schemes, and button interactions.
countdown_script.js: The JavaScript code that handles the functionality of the countdown timer, including calculating the time difference and updating the display.
How It Works
User Input: The user selects a date and time using the date and time input fields.
Start Countdown: When the "Start Countdown" button is clicked, the countdown begins, and the remaining time is updated every second.
Timer Updates: Every second, the JavaScript calculates the difference between the current time and the target date/time and updates the countdown display.
Finish Notification: When the countdown reaches zero, the timer stops and a message appears notifying the user that the countdown has finished.
Error Handling: If either the date or time is not selected, the user is prompted to select both fields.

Dependencies
This project does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks; it is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
How to Use
Open the Countdown Timer application in your browser.
Use the Date and Time input fields to select a target date and time for your countdown.
Press the Start Countdown button to begin the countdown timer.
The remaining time (in days, hours, minutes, and seconds) will be displayed and updated every second.
Once the countdown reaches zero, a message will notify you that the countdown is finished.
Example
For example, if you set the target date to 2025-01-01 and the time to 00:00, the countdown will show how much time is left until the New Year. Once it reaches zero, it will display a message like "Countdown finished!" and reset the timer display.
